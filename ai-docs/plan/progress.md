## 📚 PHASE 1: BMAD Fundamentals Deep Dive

### ✅ Session 1.1: Agent Architecture Anatomy

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Started**: 2025-10-01
**Completed**: 2025-10-01
**Duration**: ~2 hours

**Deliverables**:

- [x] Documentation of agent anatomy with annotations
- [x] Working custom agent file in `bmad-core/agents/`

**Checkpoint Passed**: ✅ Yes

**Notes**:

**Key Learnings**:

- BMAD agents are self-contained markdown files with YAML configuration blocks
- Agent structure: Header → YAML → IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION → REQUEST-RESOLUTION → activation-instructions → agent → persona → commands → dependencies
- Lazy loading principle: dependencies NOT loaded during activation, only when commands execute
- Agent activation flow: Read file → Adopt persona → Load config → Greet + \*help → HALT
- Two valid core_principles formats: "Name - Explanation" (advisory) vs "Direct statement with CRITICAL:" (execution)
- Commands structure: help (first) → agent-specific commands → yolo → exit (last)
- Template system with {PLACEHOLDERS} enables consistent agent creation

**Artifacts Created**:

- `ai-docs/plan/agent-template.md` - Clean agent template with placeholders
- `ai-docs/plan/agent-instructions.md` - Comprehensive instructions for all 15 placeholders with examples
- `bmad-core/agents/code-reviewer.md` - Custom Code Reviewer agent (validated ✓)

**Agent Design Insights**:

- Two valid formats for core_principles: "Name - Explanation" (analyst, architect) vs "Direct statement" (dev)
- Agent template system enables consistent, repeatable agent creation
- Custom agent (code-reviewer) successfully created with:
  - Unique persona (Rachel, Code Reviewer 🔍)
  - Review-focused commands (review-code, check-security, analyze-performance, suggest-improvements)
  - 9 core principles using "Name - Explanation" format
  - Minimal dependencies (only execute-checklist task)
  - Validated successfully with `npm run validate`

**Next Session Prep**:

- Review `bmad-core/tasks/` directory to understand task structure
- Prepare to analyze task system for Session 1.2

### Session 1.1 - Agent Architecture Anatomy - 2025-10-01

**Duration**: ~2 hours

**Key Learnings**:

- BMAD agents are self-contained markdown files with complete YAML configuration
- Agent structure follows consistent pattern across all agents
- Lazy loading: dependencies loaded only during command execution, not activation
- Two valid core_principles formats: "Name - Explanation" vs "Direct statement with CRITICAL:"
- Template system with placeholders enables repeatable agent creation
- Commands always structured: help → agent-specific → yolo → exit

**Challenges**:

- Understanding activation-time vs command-execution-time loading (resolved by analyzing multiple agents)
- Recognizing two different core_principles formats (resolved by comparing analyst vs dev agents)
- Creating clean template without excessive instructions (resolved by iterative refinement)

**Artifacts Created**:

- `ai-docs/plan/agent-template.md` - Clean agent template with {PLACEHOLDERS}
- `ai-docs/plan/agent-instructions.md` - Detailed instructions for all 15 placeholders
- `bmad-core/agents/code-reviewer.md` - Custom Code Reviewer agent (Rachel 🔍, validated ✓)

**Next Session Prep**:

- Review `bmad-core/tasks/` directory structure
- Read 3-4 task files to understand task anatomy
- Prepare to analyze task execution flow for Session 1.2
