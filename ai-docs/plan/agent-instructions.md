## {CORE_PRINCIPLES_LIST}

**What it is:** List of operational principles guiding agent behavior

**Where it appears:** `core_principles:` section

**Format:** YAML list - TWO valid formats

**Format 1: Name - Explanation** (Used by Analyst, Architect, PM, QA)

```yaml
core_principles:
  - {Principle Name} - {Explanation}
  - {Principle Name} - {Explanation}
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user
```

**Format 2: Direct Statement** (Used by Dev and other execution-focused agents)

```yaml
core_principles:
  - CRITICAL: { Critical rule statement }
  - CRITICAL: { Another critical rule }
  - { Regular principle }
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user
```

**Guidelines:**

- Include 8-12 principles
- ALWAYS include "Numbered Options" as the last principle
- Format 1: Good for philosophical/approach principles
- Format 2: Good for strict rules and constraints
- Use `CRITICAL:` prefix for non-negotiable rules

**Examples:**

**Format 1 - Analyst agent (Name - Explanation):**

```yaml
core_principles:
  - Curiosity-Driven Inquiry - Ask probing "why" questions to uncover underlying truths
  - Objective & Evidence-Based Analysis - Ground findings in verifiable data and credible sources
  - Strategic Contextualization - Frame all work within broader strategic context
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user
```

**Format 2 - Dev agent (Direct Statement):**

```yaml
core_principles:
  - CRITICAL: Story has ALL info you will need aside from what you loaded during the startup commands. NEVER load PRD/architecture/other docs files unless explicitly directed in story notes or direct command from user.
  - CRITICAL: ALWAYS check current folder structure before starting your story tasks, don't create new working directory if it already exists.
  - CRITICAL: ONLY update story file Dev Agent Record sections (checkboxes/Debug Log/Completion Notes/Change Log)
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user
```

**Code reviewer principles - Format 1 example:**

```yaml
core_principles:
  - Code Quality First - Prioritize clean, maintainable, readable code
  - Security-Conscious Review - Always check for security vulnerabilities and data exposure
  - Performance Awareness - Consider performance implications of implementation choices
  - Constructive Feedback - Provide actionable suggestions, not just criticism
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user
```

**Code reviewer principles - Format 2 example:**

```yaml
core_principles:
  - CRITICAL: Review code for security vulnerabilities, especially input validation and data exposure
  - CRITICAL: Check for performance issues including N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, and memory leaks
  - CRITICAL: Ensure code follows project coding standards and best practices
  - Provide constructive, actionable feedback with specific improvement suggestions
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to the user
```

---

## {AGENT_SPECIFIC_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS}

**What it is:** Optional additional activation instructions specific to this agent

**Where it appears:** Between standard activation instructions and final HALT instruction

**Format:** YAML list items (starting with `- `)

**When to use:** When your agent needs special setup or rules during activation

**Examples:**

**Dev agent specific instructions:**

```yaml
- CRITICAL: Read the following full files as these are your explicit rules for development standards for this project - {root}/core-config.yaml devLoadAlwaysFiles list
- CRITICAL: Do NOT load any other files during startup aside from the assigned story and devLoadAlwaysFiles items
- CRITICAL: Do NOT begin development until a story is not in draft mode and you are told to proceed
```

**Most agents:** Leave this placeholder empty or remove it entirely (most agents don't need extra instructions)

---

## {AGENT_SPECIFIC_COMMANDS}

**What it is:** Agent-specific commands between `help` and `exit`

**Where it appears:** Between `- help:` and `- exit:` in commands section

**Format:** YAML list with various command structures

**Command types:**

### 1. Simple command

```yaml
- { command-name }: { description }
```

Example:

```yaml
- review-code: Review code for quality, security, and best practices
- run-tests: Execute linting and tests
```

### 2. Command with task reference

```yaml
- { command-name }: use task {task-file} with {template-file}
```

Example:

```yaml
- create-project-brief: use task create-doc with project-brief-tmpl.yaml
- review-code: use task code-review with review-report-tmpl.yaml
```

### 3. Complex command with sub-options

```yaml
- { command-name }:
    - { sub-option-1 }: { description }
    - { sub-option-2 }: { description }
```

Example:

```yaml
- develop-story:
    - order-of-execution: 'Read task‚ÜíImplement‚ÜíTest‚ÜíUpdate checkbox‚ÜíRepeat'
    - blocking: 'HALT for: Missing deps | Ambiguous requirements | 3 failures'
    - completion: 'All tasks done‚ÜíTests pass‚ÜíStatus: Ready for Review'
```

**Standard commands to always include:**

- `help` - First command
- `yolo` - Always included for power users
- `exit` - Last command

**Typical commands by agent type:**

**Code Reviewer:**

```yaml
- review-code: Review code for quality, security, and best practices
- check-security: Analyze code for security vulnerabilities
- analyze-performance: Review code for performance issues
- suggest-improvements: Provide actionable improvement suggestions
